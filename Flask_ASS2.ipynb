    "GET method:\n",
    "- Used to retrieve data from a server.\n",
    "- Appends data to the URL as query parameters.\n",
    "- Limited data size (URL length constraints).\n",
    "- Data is visible in the URL (less secure).\n",
    "- Caching is possible, making it suitable for non-destructive operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "POST method:\n",
    "- Used to send data to a server to create or update a resource.\n",
    "- Sends data in the request body, not visible in the URL.\n",
    "- Can handle larger data compared to GET.\n",
    "- More secure for sensitive information.\n",
    "- Not cached by default, suitable for destructive operations and sensitive data transmission."

    "    In Flask, the \"request\" object is used to handle incoming HTTP requests from clients (typically web browsers or API clients)\n",
    "    . It allows Flask applications to access data sent by the client, such as form data, URL parameters, and JSON payloads. The\n",

    "In Flask, the \"redirect()\" function is used to perform an HTTP redirect response to a different URL. It is used when a route \n",
    "needs to redirect the user to another page or route within the application or to an external URL. This helps in implementing \n",
    "various features like after a successful form submission, user authentication, or handling page not found scenarios by redire-\n",

    "Q4. What are templates in Flask? Why is the render_template() function used?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    In Flask, templates are files that contain dynamic content and HTML structure. They allow developers to separate the prese-\n",
    "    ntation layer from the application logic, making it easier to manage and maintain web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"render_template()\" function in Flask is used to render these templates and dynamically inject data into them. It takes the\n",
    "template file as input and can also accept variables that provide dynamic data to the template. This enables developers to crea-\n",
    "te dynamic web pages by combining static HTML structure with dynamic content generated by the application. The \"render_template\n",
    "()\" function facilitates the process of generating dynamic web pages and improves the maintainability and readability of the \n",

    "Ans:\n",
    "    I apologize for the inconvenience, but as an AI language model, I don't have the capability to create a running web server or generate screenshots. However, I can provide you with a simple example of how to create a basic API using Flask.\n",

    "    app.run(debug=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Save this code in a file named `app.py`. Then, you can run the Flask server using the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python app.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, your API will be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/hello`. You can use Postman to test it by sending a GET request to that URL. The response should look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"message\": \"Hello, this is a simple API!\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, I'm unable to attach screenshots in this text-based format. But you can easily test the API using Postman or any other API testing tool and see the response yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to stop the Flask server after you're done testing by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the server is running."
